Who are our users?
- People who want to create chat bots
- Low/no programming background (that’s where Scratch comes in)
- *Need to think about specific user cases*

Narrow Down Medium – SMS, Email, FB Messenger, etc.
Think about how to devise scratch grammar to fit one or two specific use case(s)

TODO:
- [] Look into Scratch (practice, get to know the interface)
- [] Come up with use cases – decide on case/set of cases by MONDAY
- [] Look into where/how chat bots are used (i.e.: appointment scheduler)
