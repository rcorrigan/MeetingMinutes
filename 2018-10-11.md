Harley has been working on a simple version of our web application - setting up the landing page, etc. Most of the effort is spent writing html, css, and javascript, so this effort should be reusable regardless of framework.

Sam found the following html template resources, which look like they might be very useful for various parts of the project.
* Traversy Media - AdminStrap - https://github.com/MoonbrightSoftworks/AdminStrap
* BootPress

If we continue with ASP.NET Core and AWS, we might use Beanstalk to handle the actual application. This would make deploying very easy.
