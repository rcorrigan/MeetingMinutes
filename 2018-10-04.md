Brief recap of Monday's class session. Our progress sounds comparable to that of other teams.

Team member made interesting demo project with DialogFlow. This might be a cool way to extend our project, if we have the time.

Our current demo project has got three custom blocks defined in the workspace, and we're working on updating the Blockly code generator to be able to generate code that actually makes those blocks function.
