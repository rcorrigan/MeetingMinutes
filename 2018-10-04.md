Brief recap of Monday's class session. Our progress sounds comparable to that of other teams.

Team member made interesting demo project with DialogFlow. This might be a cool way to extend our project, if we have the time.

Our current demo project has got three custom blocks defined in the workspace, and we're working on updating the Blockly code generator to be able to generate code that actually makes those blocks function.

Many different possible SMS services (Twillo being explored currently).
We'll need to create custom blocks for calendar interfacing, SMS services, etc. and make them available to the user through the toolbox.

AWS for database things (or perhaps Now?)

TODO: Everyone look through Blockly intro (see link on Slack)
      Look at Scratch Chatbot example (see link on Slack)
