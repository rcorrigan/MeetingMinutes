Getting to know Scratch:

Pros:
- Scratch Blocks is a fork of Google's Blockly project, which is great because Google makes good products and documents them well
- Understandable API will (hopefully) be easy to work with/expand on
- So many examples will make it easy to learn Scratch (both for us, and for those who will use our Scratch Chat-Bot maker) – hopefully it will help us learn integrations to SMS/email (or whatever we decide) as well.
- Scratch blocks was created for our exact purpose. Its intention is to expand the use cases of scratch to more technologies. By making this project open source they hope that people, like ourselves, will create projects that use scratch blocks.

Cons:
- Some of the functionality might need to be paired back due to the limitations of Scratch blocks
- Blocks require a certain amount of “stand-alone”-ness, which may make some programming integration difficult.
- The blocks could be a bottleneck for our creativity.

General Thoughts:
- Scratch will place some limits on coding (language, implementation, etc.), which will be helpful in some ways – making it somewhat easier to decide what to use, how to do things – and restricting in other ways.
- Easily implementable UI will do a lot of the heavy lifting for us when it comes to site design.

Potential Chat Bot Uses:
- Appointment Scheduling
- Inquiring about services offered
- Inquiring about personal account/setting up an account (i.e. for utilities, phone service, etc.)
- Basic Tech Support
- Event registration/questions (such as the HelloVote example bot)
