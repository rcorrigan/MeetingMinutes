Minutes from 8 October 2018  

Harley has worked on creating custom SMS interfacing blocks as a proof of concept  
  - In Blockly (Blockly developer tools)  
  - Basic program interacts with Twillio  
  - Works using AWS lambda functions (and API gateway)  
  - Has it working on his phone  
  - Currently, can only "remember" most recent message - this will (hopefully) be fixed once we implement a database  
  - Can be extended for other services  
  
Blockly Block Factory is another option for creating custom blocks  
  - What blocks would the user want?  
  - Creating a date-selection block, etc.  

Blockly has good support for Javascript, so look at using NodeJS for interfacing with a calendar, etc.  

Need to think about front-end: how will potential chat-bot builders interact with our site? What will it look like?  
  - Look at VueJS (easy to learn)  
  - HTML/Bootstrap (?)  
  - Check out potential page-flow from earlier meeting minutes  

Check out how to work with web API's: get, post, etc.  
  - Link for reference: https://schoolofdata.org/2013/11/18/web-apis-for-non-programmers/  

TODO: Complete team evals

      Think of individual tasks
