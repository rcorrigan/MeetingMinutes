Team reviewed Scratch, individuals may want to explore Scratch more in the future

Team had trouble attending 2018-09-22 group meeting, discussion was had about finding a better time

@hwaldstein played with the Blockly Developer Tools page for creating blocks, created three example blocks and an example Workspace.

It appears that Blockly uses code generators to generate user programs into any of JavaScript, Python, PHP, Lua, and Dart. We should consider making our web server in one of these languages.

Talked about different hosting options, mentioning: AWS, Digital Ocean, Microsoft Azure

@hwaldstein thought it might be easy to create callbacks as lambda functions. They're an easy unit of management, would fit with our use cases

Action Items:
- [ ] @everyone explore Twilio API, complete at least one getting-started tutorial 
- [ ] @everyone fill out a sample chat bot program use case (under Wiki on this project)
