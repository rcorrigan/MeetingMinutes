Harley has been working on a basic "click through" view  

Callum is looking into ViewJS to create views and make them easily exportable to other sites - ViewJS is a sort of replacement for JQuery  
Kevin has been doing work on Android studio and an SQL database (he will then be able to transfer from Android Studio to Blockly)  

We need to set up a feature tracker so we don't do overlapping things/don't forget features - Rae will contact UI-JIRA administrator tomorrow to set up a JIRA feature tracking project for the team. Then we can begin adding/delegating features more formally   

People can make a proofs-of-concept for other interfaces (Email, FB Messenger, etc.), similar to how Harley made one for Twillio.    
Try out things you feel comfortable with/interested in
